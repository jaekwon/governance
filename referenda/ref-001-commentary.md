Commentary:

This document is a merger of informal governance proposals for the OL.io community. The governance scheme proposed intends to be a minimal bootstrapping governance scheme, which will allow iterations of governance to be implemented. It is the lowest common denominator among governance proposals. The structure of this document is borrowed from Bootstrapping Governance the Conservative Way.

OpenLibra may respond variously through publications, critique, thought leadership, technologies, and, _possibly_, via competing network(s) that is (are) comparably more “open”[^1] than that of Libra. OL.io governs a set of technologies, economics research, and infrastructure. OL.io owns and manages the resources outlined below.

The cooperative should seek grant funding for R&D and in so doing attract value-aligned funders. 

The governance of the OL.io cooperative should be kept simple. In the early days it should solve for transparency, efficiency, and accountability and avoiding a “tyranny of structurelessness” rather than maximizing decentralization. As the direction of Libra is unclear, OL.io should aim to be agile in its ability to continue responding. Work needs to get done and contributors must feel empowered and authorized to act, and also to exit non-contentiously. The less complex the governance mechanism the better.

One way to view the proposals above is being on a continuum.

[Bootstrapping Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hpdRliGwovpFi5maqtqFXOwsFmQyFci_YfAyJ4ZkP-g/edit) may be thought as a moment on a timeline, Alpha. It is a "minimum viable governance", very close to what we have already but adding tools (Keybase and Loomio) to establish some process.

[The Union governance proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SW8pWj3WaPmSNO2pSFx_pyLrwSXM_ty4pMmanX7aD4o/edit)  can be thought of as another point on the timeline, Omega: a point in the neighborhood of our desired steady state. This includes multiple stakeholder groups, balances of power, and accomodations for open psuedonomous participation w/ protections against plutacracy. So, we propose that is an innovative design and may be appropriate for steady state for blockchain infrastructure decision making. But it may be inappropriate for bootstrapping. In fact there is a large surface area that needs to be analyzed, while today there is urgency to formalize decision-making. OL.io should avoid specifying token economics prematurely, given many moving parts of such an implementation.

We can consider Alpha as an indication "we are here", and Omega as first glimpse of where we want to go, with the caveat that the latter is still shrouded in a fog.

The goal of Left Outer Join, or any proposal, is to find some point (Beta) which is a small step beyond Alpha in our best estimate of the direction to Omega.



We propose to implement one half of the Union Proposal, the Stewards chamber, without the Holder chamber. Future research shall determine if the Holder Chamber is appropriate, and whether it accords with the project manifesto.

The list of initial "seed" Stewards will be based on the active contributors as per the [White Pages](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bawwp4YByfsNmdCydcxgt-lDxPzTyR_ZJYAYVxOCLK8/). Selecting the members of the initial seed set is fraught, and certain to disappoint some and to those almost any decision may seem arbitrary and capricious. However it's uncontroversial that the members that delivered work products over 6 months to the Working Groups should be in that set. So we propose it be those members as the lowest common denominator of the trusted seed set. Those members can and will expand or reduce the set, as per the Union Proposal.

Additionally, we propose the use of these exemplar tools to bootstrap OL.io coop governance:

*   [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/)
*   [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) (read: dogfooding good ol’ cryptography)

## Notes

[^1]:
     “open” needs a precise definition. What does it really mean? One could argue that OL exists to discover, through a deliberative / learning process, what an open antithesis to L might look like.
